# III-Programming-Exercise
 
 
 Create programs using Java, Python, and C++ language for each of the following problems. 


 1. Body Mass Index

Design a modular program that calculates and displays a person’s body mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:

  BMI = Weight × 703 / (Height^2)



2. Paint Job Estimator

A painting company has determined that for every 115 square feet of wall space,
one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required. The company charges
$20.00 per hour for labor. Design a modular program that asks the user to enter
the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon.
The program should display the following data:
    The number of gallons of paint required
    The hours of labor required
    The cost of the paint
    The labor charges
    The total cost of the paint job
